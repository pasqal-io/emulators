class RydbergHamiltonian:
    """
    A Hamiltonian sparse form representation for the Rydberg  Hamiltonian (not complex part, yet)

    The `RydbergHamiltonian` class represents the Rydberg Hamiltonian matrix where the diagonal
    terms are the interaction Uᵢⱼ nᵢ⊗nⱼ and detunining 𝛿ᵢnᵢ and off diagonal term omegas 𝛺ᵢ𝜎ᵢˣ
    for a quantum system, allowing efficient computations such as matrix-vector multiplications.
    The Hamiltonian is parameterized by driving strengths or amplitudes 𝛺ᵢ (`omegas`), detuning
    values 𝛿ᵢ (`deltas`), and  interaction terms Uᵢⱼ (`interaction_matrix`).

    Attributes:
        omegas (torch.Tensor): amplitudes values for each qubit, scaled by a factor of 1/2.
        deltas (torch.Tensor): detuning values for each qubit.
        interaction_matrix (torch.Tensor): matrix representing pairwise Rydberg
            interaction strengths between qubits.
        nqubits (int): The number of qubits in the system.
        diag (torch.Tensor): The diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian,
            calculated based on `deltas` and `interaction_matrix`.
        inds (torch.Tensor): Index tensor used for vector manipulations
            in matrix-vector multiplications.

    Args:
        omegas (torch.Tensor): 1D tensor of driving strengths for each qubit.
        deltas (torch.Tensor): 1D tensor of detuning values for each qubit.
        interaction_matrix (torch.Tensor): 2D tensor representing the interaction
            strengths between each pair of qubits.

    Methods:
        __mul__(vec): Performs matrix-vector multiplication with a vector.
        _diag_elemts(): Constructs the diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian
            based on `deltas` and `interaction_matrix`.
        _size(): Calculates the memory size of the `RydbergHamiltonian` object in MiB.
