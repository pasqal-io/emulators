****_ISSUE Title_** :**

Every ticket is meant to represent an ****action**** to be done and this can be easily described by an action ****verb****.


-------------
****_Goal(s)_** :**
One sentence explaining why and what.

Remark : It is okay to have open points in an issue ticket. Don't say _To decide._ it does not  help.
Better it would be _to have_
-- _To decide between solution A or B because respectively of X or Y  --_

-------------
****_Description_** _:_**
If the issue is part of an Epic, it is worth to mention what it is supposed to be already done
 -- _we suppose A and B were already done, here we do C_--.

**Bullet point** list of actions for the C action:
1. C.1 for reason X
2. C.2 for reason Y

Note: Technical details left out from the Epic here are welcome!
Note 2: For particularly nasty tasks leave here a trace of the discussion had with the team.

-------------
**_Acceptance Criteria_**
We can look at the epic and check which criteria are relevant for this specific issue and report in more details if needed.

(_If it helps, use theF ****GIVEN-\>WHEN-\>THEN.**** scheme._)


__GIVEN__ that I have sent to run a small simulation on both EMU-TN and Pulser with the AOM (EOM) feature enabled
__WHEN__ I check the results that I have obtained
__THEN__ the results look “close enough”

-------------
**_Before creating the ticket:_**
1. _Check that the \*NEW\* label is attached to it._
2. _If the ticket belongs to an already existing Epic, link the ticket to it._
