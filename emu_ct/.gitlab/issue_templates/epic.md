**_EPIC Title_** :
Every ticket is meant to represent an ****action**** to be done and this can be easily described by an action ****verb****.

 -------------

****_Goal(s)_** :**

One sentence explaining why and what.

   -------------

****_Description_** _:_**

Here we can create the list of bullet points containing the main actions and the reason for doing them “we do A because of B” .
It is a good place to put the accent on the user needs and point of view of what we create.
The poor PO must understand at this point 95%!

  -------------
**_Issue Split :_**

In this exercise we have to be sure that:

* all the steps required to reach the scope are clearly defined and the logical path to follow is clear
* all the steps are as much independent as possible among them
* we have as many issue tickets as many steps we have identified

 -------------

**_Acceptance Criteria_**
We should think of the functional checks used to prove that the implementation is successful.
They can be high level integration  PO or the QA team could potentially run or verify.

(_If it helps, use theF ****GIVEN-\>WHEN-\>THEN.**** scheme._)



__GIVEN__ that I have sent to run a small simulation on both EMU-TN and Pulser with the AOM (EOM) feature enabled
__WHEN__ I check the results that I have obtained
__THEN__ the results look “close enough”


-------------
**_Before creating the ticket:_**
1. _Check that the \*NEW\* label is attached to it._
2. _Check that all the issue tickets are linked_
3. _Don’t forget to promote your ticket to an Epic!_
