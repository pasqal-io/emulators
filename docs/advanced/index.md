You have reached the advanced topics. Links to the individual pages discussing the various topics can be found in the sidebar to the left.
The content here all relates to the inner workings of emu-mps and is more conceptual in nature. You will not find information here about
how to actually run a simulation, but rather

- What Hamiltonian the emulator uses for time-evolution
- Some relevant information about the MPS representation
- A summary of the TDVP algorithm
- What sources of error TDVP incurs
- What the various configuration parameters mean mathematically
- How to determine whether your results are accurate
- How to estimate the memory consumption of a simulation in advance

For the experienced user, this will help get the most out of emu-mps.
